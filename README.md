# web-programiranje-projekt

The minimum requirements for creating the project task (web application) are as follows:

- Meaningful Content: Each logical part of the application should have a short description (NO Lorem ipsum ...).
- Web Application Structure: The web application can consist of multiple HTML documents or be in the form of a SPA (Single Page Application).
- Styling: For styling the content display, you can use custom-made CSS or frameworks such as Bootstrap or W3CSS.
- Responsive Design: The content must be responsive.
- Dynamic Front-End: The front-end part of the application should include elements that change dynamically (navigation, content of specific document parts) - this can include handling data on the client side and dynamic data display, client-side data validation, AJAX requests to external or custom APIs.
- Back-End: The back-end should include a user-written API for accessing the database.
- Database: The database can be local or web-based (e.g., Firebase or another service - in the case of using a Firebase database, include Firebase database access in the back-end part).
- Data Exchange Format: The data format for exchange between the application (front-end) and the server (back-end) should be JSON.

A web application has been developed as a flower encyclopedia, resembling a Wikipedia for flowers. Users can log in or register to browse the entered flower information, add flowers to their favorites, and access a personalized page with their favorite flowers. By clicking on a specific flower, users can open a modal with more detailed information about that flower.
A table is also available, displaying the blooming months of all flowers, sorted by the first month of blooming. All users have the ability to add new flowers. Administrators have additional privileges, allowing them to add new flowers, delete any existing flowers, or edit flower information. Regular users do not have access to the flower editing page.
